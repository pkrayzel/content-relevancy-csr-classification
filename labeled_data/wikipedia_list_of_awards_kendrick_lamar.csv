List of awards and nominations received by Kendrick Lamar - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Kendrick_Lamar|^ Certain award groups do not simply award one winner. They acknowledge several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.|1

Lamar's second album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), earned him seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including for Album of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Rap Album. His third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), was preceded by the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance-winning single ""I"".
