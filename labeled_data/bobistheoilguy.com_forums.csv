Most stubby pneumatic impacts will still be lighter, stronger and shorter than that gun.

TTC testing shows those wrenches to be pretty weak. Not sure if they’ll be good for much more than spark plugs or a bracket bolt. 

IIRC, @atikovi had one and was unimpressed.

I have the occasional need to use this one and it has always done good by me. It is far more capable than a bracket bolt or a spark plug, doing an old rotted in ball joint old Subaru without a lift is a PITA once the removal tool is installed there is very little clearance. This was the only tool that would fit and it took it right out. It is not a replacement for a regular impact gun but it definitely has its place.

@Trav has used his a lot more than I've used mine, but it hasn't let me down yet. It had no problem removing starter bolts, and doing a recent brake and rotor job for a friend. I used the Aircat for the clutch, job but I'm sure it would have been up to the task for that too. Like anything tools, there are several options, this shines when you need something with a flex-head.

Not sure if I agree, but to each their own. Most of those use cases do not require an impact; you can just break the fastener loose with a long 1/2” ratchet and zip out the bolts using a small cordless or pneumatic ratchet. 

As for the ball joint tool, all of the ones I have ever used say to never use with an impact.

As far as the ball joint tool goes it is made for use with an impact. When you use a wrench on the Astro remover the pins tend to break but no so with an impact. The Astro is as good or better than the one from Snap on and most of the others, I have owned and used most of them.

Never used that type of remover. Then again, we don’t get rust down here and I also do not see many Subarus. 

All of the Subaru’s I have done…the BJ came out without requiring that tool.

Anyway, if the flex right angle impact works for you, I’m glad that someone came up with a solution to a problem you have. But it is clear that this type of tool is not very popular and mechanics lived without it for a long time, so I’m not convinced that it is suddenly a necessity….especially at the low output it delivers.
