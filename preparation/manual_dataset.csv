I have the occasional need to use this one and it has always done good by me. It is far more capable than a bracket bolt or a spark plug, doing an old rotted in ball joint old Subaru without a lift is a PITA once the removal tool is installed there is very little clearance. This was the only tool that would fit and it took it right out. It is not a replacement for a regular impact gun but it definitely has its place."|1

@Trav has used his a lot more than I've used mine, but it hasn't let me down yet. It had no problem removing starter bolts, and doing a recent brake and rotor job for a friend. I used the Aircat for the clutch, job but I'm sure it would have been up to the task for that too. Like anything tools, there are several options, this shines when you need something with a flex-head."|1

Not sure if I agree, but to each their own. Most of those use cases do not require an impact; you can just break the fastener loose with a long 1/2” ratchet and zip out the bolts using a small cordless or pneumatic ratchet. 

As for the ball joint tool, all of the ones I have ever used say to never use with an impact.

Never used that type of remover. Then again, we don’t get rust down here and I also do not see many Subarus. 

All of the Subaru’s I have done…the BJ came out without requiring that tool.

Anyway, if the flex right angle impact works for you, I’m glad that someone came up with a solution to a problem you have. But it is clear that this type of tool is not very popular and mechanics lived without it for a long time, so I’m not convinced that it is suddenly a necessity….especially at the low output it delivers."|1

Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.|0

Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.|0

Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.|0

Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.|0
Our Best Dessert Recipes|https://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/desserts|An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.|0

What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"AI seems to have a branding problem. Even ""artificial intelligence"" doesn't really have a useful definition, so when it comes to the nitty-gritty of specific companies, models, and apps, all bets are off.&nbsp;"|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Example: lots of people talk about OpenAI, ChatGPT, and GPT as if they're the same thing (they're not).|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|OpenAI is an AI research company.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT is a family of AI models built by OpenAI.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses GPT.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Here, I'm focusing on GPT.What is GPT?|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Try Zapier's AI features|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Discover how AI gives you automation superpowers.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT is a family of AI models built by OpenAI. It stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which is basically a description of what the AI models do and how they work (I'll dig into that more in a minute). Initially, GPT was made up of only LLMs (large language models). But OpenAI has since expanded this to include two new models:|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT-4o: a large multimodal model (LMM)|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT-4o mini: a small language model (SLM) |1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|While I'll frequently use ChatGPT as an example in this article, it's important to remember that GPT is more than just ChatGPT—it's an entire family of models.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT models are designed to generate human-like responses to a GPT prompt. Initially, these prompts had to be text-based, but the latest versions of GPT (GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini) can also work with images and audio inputs because they're multimodal. |1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|This allows GPT-based tools to do things like:|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Answer questions in a conversational manner&nbsp;(with text or voice chat)|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Generate blog posts and other kinds of short- and long-form content|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Edit content for tone, style, and grammar|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Summarize long passages of text|1

What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Write code based on design mockups|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|And that's just the tip of the LMM.Examples of tools using GPT in the background|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|As you can imagine, GPT is used in a wide variety of different applications. The most well-known is ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, which uses a fine-tuned version of GPT that's optimized for dialogue and conversation.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|But because GPT has an API, lots of developers have been building on top of it. Here are some other places where GPT is working behind the scenes:|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Microsoft products. Bing's AI search and Microsoft Copilot (all the AI features Microsoft is adding to Word, Excel, and its other Office apps) have GPT working in the background.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Sudowrite is a GPT-powered app designed to help people write short stories, novels, and other works of fiction. In fact, many (if not most) AI writing generators use GPT as at least one of the models powering the app.|1

What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Zapier uses GPT in the background for many of its AI capabilities, including its AI chatbot builder and AI agent builder.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|In short, if you can think of a situation where generating high quality, human-like text could help, GPT can probably be employed to do it—and likely already is.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Other AI models, like Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and Anthropic's Claude, are becoming more popular for developers, but GPT was the first widely available effective AI API that developers could use to power their own apps, so you'll see it almost everywhere you look—and most places you don't look, too.How did we get to GPT?|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"In the mid-2010s, the best performing AI models relied on manually-labeled data, like a database with photos of different animals paired with a text description of each animal written by humans. It was a process called ""supervised learning,"" and it was used to develop the underlying algorithms for the models.&nbsp;"|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|While supervised learning can be effective in some circumstances, the training datasets are incredibly expensive to produce. Even now, there just isn't that much data suitably labeled and categorized to be used to train LLMs.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Things changed with BERT, Google's LLM introduced in 2018. It used the transformer model—first proposed in a 2017 research paper—which fundamentally simplified how AI algorithms were designed. It allows for the computations to be parallelized (done at the same time), which means significantly reduced training times, and it makes it easier for models to be trained on unstructured data. Not only did it make AI models better; it also made them quicker and cheaper to produce.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|From there, the first version of GPT was documented in a paper published in 2018, and GPT-2 was released the following year. It was capable of generating a few sentences at a time before things got weird. While both represented significant advances in the field of AI research, neither was suitable for large-scale real-world use. That changed with the launch of GPT-3 in 2020. While it took a while—and the launch of ChatGPT—to really take off, it was the first truly useful, widely available LLM.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|And that's why GPT is the big name in LLMs right now, even though it's far from the only large language model available. Plus, OpenAI continues to upgrade—most recently, with GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"""Generative Pre-trained Transformer model"" is really just a description of what the GPT family of models does, how they were designed, and how they work.&nbsp;"|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|I'm going to use GPT-3 as an example because it's the model that we have the most information about. (Unfortunately, OpenAI has become a lot more secretive about its processes over the years.)|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|GPT-3 was pre-trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data. It was basically fed the entire open internet and then left to crunch through and draw its own connections. This technique is called deep learning, and it's a fundamental part of machine learning, which is how most modern AI tools are developed.&nbsp;|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|It's important to keep in mind that GPT doesn't understand text quite the same way as humans do. Instead of words, AI models break text down into tokens. Many words map to single tokens, though longer or more complex words often break down into multiple tokens. GPT-3 was trained on roughly 500 billion tokens.&nbsp;|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|All this training is used to create a complex, many-layered, weighted algorithm modeled after the human brain, called a deep learning neural network. It's what allows GPT-3 to understand patterns and relationships in the text data and tap into the ability to create human-like responses. GPT-3's neural network has 175 billion parameters (or variables) that allow it to take an input—your prompt—and then, based on the values and weightings it gives to the different parameters (and a small amount of randomness), outputs whatever it thinks best matches your request.|1

What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"GPT's network uses the transformer architecture—it's the ""T"" in GPT. At the core of transformers is a process called ""self-attention."" Older recurrent neural networks (RNNs) read text from left-to-right. Transformer-based networks, on the other hand, read every token in a sentence at the same time and compare each token to all the others. This allows them to direct their ""attention"" to the most relevant tokens, no matter where they are in the text."|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"Of course, this is all vastly simplifying things. GPT can't really understand anything. Instead, every token is encoded as a vector (a number with position and direction). The closer together that two token-vectors are, the more closely related GPT thinks they are. This is why it's able to process the difference between brown bears, the right to bear arms, and ball bearings. While all use the string of letters ""bear,"" it's encoded in such a way that the neural network can tell from context what meaning is most likely to be relevant.&nbsp;"|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|Another important note: that's all just describing LLMs. Now that GPT offers a multimodal model (GPT-4o), things are different. In addition to an unimaginable quantity of text, multimodal models are also trained on millions or billions of images (with accompanying text descriptions), video clips, audio snippets, and examples of any other modality that the AI model is designed to understand (e.g., code). Crucially, all this training happens at the same time. |1

What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|"OpenAI calls the process ""alignment."" The idea is that AI systems should align with human values and follow human intent, not do their own thing and go rogue. A big part of this is a process called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)."|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|The basics of it are that AI trainers at OpenAI created demonstration data showing GPT how to respond to typical prompts. From that, they built an AI reward model with comparison data. Multiple model responses are ranked, so the AI can learn what are and aren't appropriate responses in given situations. The AI was then trained using the reward model and fine-tuned to give helpful responses. (This is also how ChatGPT was optimized to respond to dialogue.)|1
What is GPT? Everything you need to know|https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-gpt/|While no system is perfect, OpenAI has done a very good job of making GPT as helpful and harmless as possible—at least when people aren't actively trying to get around its guardrails.&nbsp;How to try GPT for yourself|1

Aubrey Plaza - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza|Early life and education|1
Aubrey Plaza - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza|Aubrey Christina Plaza was born on June 26, 1984, in Wilmington, Delaware.[2] The eldest of three sisters,[3] she was born when her parents, Bernadette and David Plaza, were 19 and 20. Plaza said she was inspired by their work ethic; when she was young, they worked various jobs to make ends meet and attended night school in pursuit of their respective professional qualifications to become an attorney and financial advisor.[4][5][6][7] Her paternal family is Puerto Rican:[8][9] her grandfather was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and moved to the mainland US when he was 17 years old.[10] She also has some Indigenous American (Taíno) heritage.[11][12] Plaza's mother, who was adopted, is of Irish descent[13][14][5] and her maternal (adoptive) grandparents were from Ireland, where their family remained, though her grandfather was also himself adopted.[15] While her parents worked, Plaza was raised by her Irish grandparents and her Puerto Rican family.[13][16]|1
Aubrey Plaza - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza|"As a child, Plaza loved films and actively engaged in imaginative play.[13] She described herself as shy and quiet until middle school, when she discovered and acted in community theater.[17][5][18] Plaza said her upbringing was ""very Catholic"",[19][20][21] and she attended Ursuline Academy, an all-girls Catholic school. While in high school, she was student-council president of her school, performed in theatrical productions with the Wilmington Drama League and the Delaware Theatre Company,[3][22] and made short films as a hobby.[23][24] Aged sixteen, she represented Ursuline at a Delaware youth leadership conference held by Joe Biden.[25][26] As a teen, Plaza's aunt gave her a job at a video store, during which she discovered her love of independent films and filmmakers that inspired her, such as John Waters and Christopher Guest. Waters' satirical film Serial Mom (1994) made a significant impact on her, and she connected with his comedic sensibility.[31][15] She also enrolled at an improv school in Philadelphia[14] and, in 2001, attended New York Film Academy's summer camp for filmmaking.[32] She graduated the following year from Ursuline Academy and moved to New York.[17] Plaza studied film and television production at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 2006.[3][33]"|1

Aubrey Plaza - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza|"Plaza trained and performed improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre since 2004.[3][34][18] She also performed at the Laugh Factory and The Improv.[32] Plaza named Amy Poehler as an inspiration for her decision to perform improv.[30][35] She described her experience at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre as ""intoxicating"", explaining: ""It just truly felt like we are in an underground – literally, underground – theatre doing an art form that is so fucking hard, and just so fun when you get it right.""[35] While she was in film school, she had an internship at Saturday Night Live for the 2004–2005 season, and another as an NBC page, during which she appeared in an episode of 30 Rock in 2006.[4][36] She was also in two short films in 2006, Killswitch and In Love.[37] In 2008, she was part of an Improv Everywhere sketch where she and others took an entire desktop computer and monitor to a Starbucks in New York City.[38][33] Plaza had a recurring role in Maggie Carey's web series The Jeannie Tate Show, played the role of Robin Gibney in ESPN's Mayne Street (2008),[33][16] and appeared in the first episode of ""Terrible Decisions with Ben Schwartz"" on Funny or Die.[39]"|1
Aubrey Plaza - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza|In 2009, she made her feature film debut in Derrick Comedy's Mystery Team. She then played a standup comic and Seth Rogen's love interest in the black comedy-drama film Funny People, directed by Judd Apatow.[33] As she did not have experience performing standup, she signed up for open mic nights at comedy clubs and bars in New York City to prepare for the role.[32][23] For her audition tape, she performed and recorded five minutes of standup comedy at her friend Donald Glover's standup show.[40][16] When Plaza flew to Los Angeles for Funny People, the film's casting director Allison Jones asked her if she wanted to attend other meetings while she was in the city. Jones set up a meeting with Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who were developing Parks and Recreation. At the meeting, they told her the idea for the show's pilot and that they were considering giving Amy Poehler's character an assistant who was a doltish blonde. Plaza pitched them instead the character of a smart intern who is at the department only for college credit and does not care about the job, which Plaza thought would be an interesting, comedic contrast with Poehler's character. They liked the concept for the character and created April Ludgate.[41][13][6][40] Plaza, who said that in real life she was like Poehler's earnestly hard-working character, took inspiration from her younger sister for April's apathetic disposition.[42][43][5] Plaza played the role from 2009 to 2015. She received praise for her performance, and April was considered one of the show's breakout characters.[2][44]|1

Plaza was cast in the film, playing the supporting character Julie Powers.[33][16] On March 12, 2010, Plaza performed at A Night of 140 Tweets: A Celebrity Tweetathon for Haiti, produced by Rob Huebel, Paul Scheer, Ben Stiller, and Mike Rosenstein, at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles.[45] In the breaks between filming Parks and Recreation seasons, Plaza appeared in other projects, films and television series.

One of the first viral videos of the Israel–Hamas war,[3] the footage showed Levy with multiple visible injuries and a large bloodstain on the seat of her gray sweatpants, which gave rise to widespread speculation that she had been sexually abused.[4] Images from the footage have come to symbolize sexual and gender based violence against Israeli women during the attacks.|1
Kidnapping of Naama Levy - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Naama_Levy|On 22 May 2024, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released footage compiled from Hamas militants' bodycams, showing Levy and other female soldiers being held captive at the surveillance base on the morning of 7 October. The families approved the release of the footage partly to pressure the Israeli government to resume hostage negotiations with Hamas.|1

She was filmed being taken from the trunk of a Jeep and pushed into the interior of the vehicle by armed militants while bystanders chanted ""God is Great"" in Arabic (Arabic: الله أكبر ).[10] Her mother, who did not see the video until at least a day after the attack, stated that she was unsure the disheveled and bloody woman in the video was her daughter. However, Levy's father confirmed the footage was of Naama Levy.[15]"|1

Kidnapping of Naama Levy - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Naama_Levy|On 25 January, Levy and fellow IDF observers Liri Albag, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa were handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross in Palestine Square in Gaza. The handover occurred after a ceremony in which Hamas dressed the four hostages in military fatigues (during the kidnapping, the victims were wearing civilian clothing) and paraded them on a stage. Shortly after the handover, the former hostages were transferred to the IDF by the Red Cross and reunited with their families in Israel.[32][33]|1
Kidnapping of Naama Levy - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Naama_Levy|In a public social media post a few days after her release, Levy offered thanks to IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians stating that during her captivity she was able to see them fighting for her. While she had been reportedly alone for the first 50 days of captivity, she said that she was later held with other IDF observers and they had supported one another during captivity and since release.[34][35]|1
Kidnapping of Naama Levy - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Naama_Levy|Following her release, it was reported that Levy and other members of her all-female IDF observer unit had documented, prior to being taken hostage, unusual practice raids and drills by Hamas taking place on the Gaza side of the border fence. Their warnings were ignored by officials within Israel.[36]|1

List of awards and nominations received by Kendrick Lamar - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Kendrick_Lamar|^ Certain award groups do not simply award one winner. They acknowledge several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.|1
List of awards and nominations received by Kendrick Lamar - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Kendrick_Lamar|"Throughout his career, American rapper and songwriter Kendrick Lamar has received several awards, nominations, and cultural honors. He signed to Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005 and released his debut studio album, Section.80, in 2011. At the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, the album received a nomination for Best Mixtape. Lamar's second album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), earned him seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including for Album of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Rap Album. His third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), was preceded by the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance-winning single ""I"".

&l;/em&g;&l;/strong&g;&l;em&g;This rainbow appears unusually low in the sky because it has formed early in the afternoon, rather than toward sunset. For a rainbow to form, water droplets must be present in the air in front of an observer and the sun must be shining from behind the observer. Rainbows result from the refraction and reflection of sunlight by these water droplets. (&l;/em&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/imagegallery%3A371\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Bob Henson, via UCAR Digital Image Library&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;&l;em&g;)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Given that the very first entry in Dr. Jeff Masters&a;rsquo; WunderBlog (the original name of this blog) was &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-360degree-rainbow.html\&q;&g;The 360-degree Rainbow&l;/a&g;&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;see the full story in &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/So-Long-Wunderground\&q;&g;Jeff&a;rsquo;s farewell post&l;/a&g; from October 2019&a;mdash;I thought it would be apropos for this final Category 6 entry to spotlight another, very different kind of rainbow. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I took the photo above looking east-northeast while stopped on a drive across northwest Oklahoma in April 1991, with a severe thunderstorm in the distance. I&a;rsquo;d never seen a &a;ldquo;rainbow rise&a;rdquo; before, and I&a;rsquo;ve certainly never seen anything that was as distinct as this. Primary rainbows always form opposite the sun, with an imaginary line running from the sun through the observer&a;rsquo;s head to the center of the rainbow arc. So in order to see a rainbow near the horizon, the sun needs to be almost 42&a;deg; above the opposite horizon. That&s;s typically the case in the early to mid-afternoon (solar time) in midlatitude spring, as was the case on the stormy April day when I snapped this photo.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Rainbows are laden with symbolism, especially about places that lie beyond our human reckoning. When our pets die, we talk about them crossing the &a;ldquo;rainbow bridge.&a;rdquo; A 16-year-old Judy Garland sang longingly about a place &a;ldquo;over the rainbow&a;rdquo; in &a;ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;the most famous movie of all time in which a weather event (that mesmerizing tornado!) served as the central plot twist (no pun intended).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I like to think of the rainbow pictured above as symbolizing the multitudinous human colors and textures that have made this meeting place what it is. Collectively, our readers have contributed far more content to Category 6 than we regular authors have, and you&a;rsquo;ve made it a welcoming spot for people from many ages, many walks of life, and many corners of the planet. I can&a;rsquo;t do justice to all of you in a single farewell post, but I hope you will each consider this a heartfelt &a;ldquo;thank you&a;rdquo; for every weather tidbit you&a;rsquo;ve shared and every friendship you&a;rsquo;ve cultivated here. I hope you&a;rsquo;ll all sign the yearbook, as it were, in the Disqus comments below (and be sure to check out the moving testimonials at the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;&a;ldquo;end of an era&a;rdquo; announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I&a;rsquo;m especially glad that this blog has been a place for serious discussion of human-produced climate change, the environmental issue of our lives. Since Jeff Masters started this blog in 2005, the global concentration of carbon dioxide has &l;a href=\&q;https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png\&q;&g;risen&l;/a&g; from about 380 to 415 parts per million&a;mdash;an increase of nearly 10%. Methane concentrations have &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#/media/File:Mlo_ch4_ts_obs_03437.png\&q;&g;jumped&l;/a&g; from about 1780 to 1870 parts per billion. And global surface temperature has &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2019?trend=true&a;amp;trend_base=10&a;amp;begtrendyear=2005&a;amp;endtrendyear=2020\&q;&g;spiked&l;/a&g; by a frightening 0.5&a;deg;F (0.3&a;deg;C). You&a;rsquo;ve read in our many posts about the consequences: heat- and drought-fueled wildfires, record rains from a juiced-up atmosphere, the effects of a warming planet on a vast range of ecosystems. As disasters typically do, the myriad impacts of climate change tend to hit those who are most vulnerable, including people of color, the hardest. We&a;rsquo;re not doing close to enough to keep this slow-motion catastrophe at bay.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/commentary-covid-19-is-the-quiz-climate-change-the-final-exam/\&q;&g;As Jeff put it&l;/a&g; this week in a post at &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/section/eye-on-the-storm/\&q;&g;Eye on the Storm&l;/a&g;,&a;rdquo; his new blogging home:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Many students&a;rsquo; recurring nightmares involve a final exam tomorrow for a course they seldom attended all term: They can&a;rsquo;t remember where the classroom is, and barely studied for the exam. Unfortunately, that nightmare describes humanity&a;rsquo;s situation for the coming climate change final exam. While the stakes for flunking the COVID-19 quiz have been crushing&a;mdash;over 425,000 people dead globally by mid-June, economies crippled, and an as-yet unrealized catastrophe looming for many nations in the developing world&a;mdash;the cost of failing our inevitable collective climate change final exam will be apocalyptic for civilization.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here are a few more words from Dr. Masters on the occasion of Cat 6&a;rsquo;s final post: &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The sun has set upon the Weather Underground blog community. It was an amazing place to learn about weather and share knowledge and experiences with other weather enthusiasts, and my life has been touched and transformed by the people who gathered here.

(Humboldt State University)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;We have all read about famous scientists who helped to shape and steer our knowledge of the world. Back in the 19th century, there were the likes of Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, Thomas Edison, Madame Curie, and many more whose contributions are well documented. Then there are those names that may have not made it into our grade school and high school history books. We may know them from other references, like a mountain or ocean current, such as the Humboldt Current off the coast of South America. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I never really thought about who this &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rdquo; was and what his contributions might have been. Coming from Buffalo, New York, I was familiar with places like Humboldt Park and the beautiful tree-lined road that once crossed the city, known as Humboldt Parkway. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Decades flew by, until one day in 2016 I was listening to an interview with a historian and author, Andrea Wulf, who had just published a book titled &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;. As I listened, I nearly jumped off my chair to hear about the amazing life of the 19th-century Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. In particular, I was fascinated with his connections to the science of meteorology and climatology. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;It turns out that Humboldt was one of the world&a;rsquo;s most famous scientists of his era, and a thinker ahead of his time in many ways. As Laura Dassow Walls put it in an American Scientist &l;a href=\&q;https://www.americanscientist.org/article/o-pioneer\&q;&g;review&l;/a&g; of &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;How on earth did we ever lose sight of Alexander von Humboldt?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Bringing it together&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Science was beginning to advance more and more rapidly in the 19th century as technology, communication, education, and the Industrial Revolution moved forward. These advances covered the full range of scientific disciplines, including the study of the weather and climate. Here in the U.S., the early 1800s brought a plethora of daily weather observations from all parts of the expanding nation. In Europe, manned and unmanned balloon flights were taking weather instruments to heights never measured before. Information on the weather and climate from locations around the world was being recorded. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;But how could all of this information be shared? How could one tie it all together?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Enter Alexander von Humboldt, considered by many to be the father of &l;a href=\&q;file:///Users/bobhenson/Downloads/and%20father%20of%20modern%20geography%20and%20ecology\&q;&g;modern geography and ecology&l;/a&g;. As Wulf noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, he was &a;ldquo;described by his contemporaries as the most famous man in the world behind Napoleon&a;rdquo;. Praises from some of the most famous persons of the time were nearly endless. Thomas Jefferson called him &a;ldquo;the most scientific man of his age&a;rdquo;. Charles Darwin said that &a;ldquo;nothing ever stimulated my zeal so much as reading Humboldt&a;rsquo;s Personal Narrative,&a;rdquo; going on to say that he would have never boarded the Beagle (his ship that toured the Galapagos) nor conceived of the Origin of the Species, without Humboldt. Henry David Thoreau read Humboldt&a;rsquo;s books and used them as a template to develop his ability to weave poetry and nature together. Years after Humboldt&a;rsquo;s death, John Muir, America&s;s most famous and influential naturalist and conservationist and founder of the Sierra Club, carried two of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s most famous books with him wherever he journeyed, annotating passages throughout the works. Humboldt&a;rsquo;s book &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Views of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g; even inspired the renowned science fiction writer Jules Verne in some of his greatest works. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In 1869, on the 100th anniversary of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s birth, the world celebrated this man like no other. In his home city of Berlin, 80,000 revelers braved a cold, stormy day. In New York, 25,000 were on hand as a large bronze bust of Humboldt was unveiled. In Boston, Ralph Waldo Emerson told celebrants that Humboldt was &a;ldquo;one of the wonders of the world&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;According to &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;more places are named after Humboldt than anyone else.&a;rdquo; There&a;rsquo;s of course the Humboldt Current that runs off the coast of South America, but also Humboldt Glacier in Greenland, mountain ranges on at least three continents, rivers, waterfalls and parks. In North America, there are 4 counties and 13 towns named for him. Did you know that Humboldt was among the names proposed for Nevada during a state constitutional convention in 1864?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was born in 1769 in Prussia and, during the course of his long life, set about to study nature on a scale as never before. What I love about Humboldt is that he was able to see Earth as one great organism where everything was connected. It was a bold new vision of nature that to this day influences the way in which we understand our natural world. It also connects the scientific thinking of his time with the views of many indigenous cultures around the world that also see Earth as an interconnected system.&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;An exploring spirit&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;As a young man, Humboldt became fascinated with scientific instruments, meticulously measuring and observing, but he was also driven by the sheer sense of wonder in all that was around him. Raised during a period of intellectual enlightenment in Europe, Humboldt had the good fortune as a young man to meet some of the greatest explorers and scientist of their age. He read the journals of Captain James Cook, who circumnavigated the globe, and on a visit to London he was able to meet and speak with Joseph Banks, the botanist for Cook&a;rsquo;s first voyage. In his early 20s, Humboldt was in the right place at the right time again when he enrolled in the School of Mines at Freiberg, Germany. The academy taught the latest geological theories and was the home for a thriving scientific community with top students and professors from across Europe. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through his brother Wilhelm, Humboldt met Germany&a;rsquo;s greatest poet of the time, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who also was a passionate scientist with a keen interest in everything from geology to botany. Over the course of several months working with Goethe, Humboldt continued to form his theories on how nature was connected. Humboldt was the consummate scientist, believing in objectivity and taking the greatest strides to ensure the most accurate measurements and eventual generalization of results. Goethe, meanwhile, aligned himself with the observation process itself and the inevitable subjectivity in human perception and understanding. Humboldt eventually was able to draw from both perspectives. In fact, as author Wulf notes, &a;ldquo;comparison became Humboldt&a;rsquo;s primary means of understanding nature, not abstract mathematics or numbers&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;At a time when other scientists were searching for the universal laws of nature, Humboldt wrote that nature had to be experienced through feelings. He wanted to travel the world and experience nature in the most personal way. He was uniquely gifted and well-prepared to accomplish this task. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was known to have an extraordinary memory. He could remember the smallest details of the shape of a leaf, the color of a rock, a temperature reading from atop a mountain for years. His mind worked in all directions, and many people noted that when he spoke, he talked so fast that barely anybody could keep up with him. When he wrote, he would jot down notes on all margins of the page, when he ran out of room he would write on his desk, and as &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;Andrea Wulf notes&l;/a&g;, &a;ldquo;When he ran out of space, Humboldt used his large desk on which he carved and scribbled ideas. Soon the entire table-top was completely covered with numbers, lines and words, so much so that a carpenter had to be called in to plane it clean again.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;After his parents died, Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm received a sizable inheritance that allowed him to live his dreams of exploring the world. In 1799, luck prevailed on him again, when King Carlos of Spain granted him a passport to explore the colonies of Latin America. Soon he was on his first expedition that framed the rest of his life. In a period of five years, it would change Humboldt from a curious and talented young man to the most extraordinary scientist of his age. Here is where he would seek nature with both head and heart. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Karl Freiesleben in June of 1799, Humboldt stated &a;ldquo;I shall endeavor to find out how nature&s;s forces act upon one another, and in what manner the geographic environment exerts its influence on animals and plants. In short, I must find out about the harmony in nature&a;rdquo;. He set out from Spain with Aim&a;eacute; Bonpland, a French botanist who accompanied him throughout Latin America. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As would be expected by someone as meticulous as Humboldt, he was very prepared for his scientific journey. In a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00431672.2016.1226641\&q;&g;Weatherwise article&l;/a&g; on Humboldt, Stephen Vermette noted that Alexander took with him no less than 42 instruments ranging from &a;ldquo;navigation and surveying to a microscope to observe small detail and to identify species, and instruments to measure magnetism&a;rdquo;. His cache included two mercurial barometers, several thermometers, a rain gauge, two hygrometers to measure humidity, a cyanometer to measure the blue color of the sky, a hypsometer which determines the temperature at which water boils at different altitudes and a eudiometer to measure the volume of gases. With those tools, he was able to compare observations he had made all over the world across decades and thousands of miles of exploration, allowing him to begin to interconnect nature on a world-wide scale. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As noted above, one of the most astonishing traits that characterized Humboldt was his amazing memory. Whenever he picked up a plant, rock or insect, that brain was wired in a way that allowed his mind to race back to what he had seen in Europe years before and instantly make a comparison, allowing him to connect these observations across the globe. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s South American expedition culminated in the ascent of Chimborazo, an extinct volcano that rose nearly 21,000 feet into the atmosphere. At that time, Chimborazo was considered by Europeans to be the highest mountain in the world. The harrowing climb almost took his life. As noted in The Invention of Nature, porters abandoned him and his team of scientists at 15,600 feet. They continued on, experiencing nausea and dizziness with altitude sickness, bloodshot eyes, bleeding gums, and nearly constant vertigo. But despite these difficulties, Humboldt still had the energy to set up his instruments every few hundred feet of ascent, and with half-frozen hands was able to continue to take extremely accurate measurements of temperature and pressure among others. They made it to 19,413 feet&a;mdash;a higher elevation than any European had experienced before, even the continent&a;rsquo;s early balloonists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;When Humboldt reached that point and looked across the vista from Chimborazo, his amazing mind was able to trace back to all the plants, rocks, and measurements he had made on his journeys in Europe through the Alps and Pyrenees. At once everything he had ever observed fell into place. It was as if he could see nature as a &a;ldquo;web of life&a;rdquo;. This new idea of nature was to forever change the way in which people understood the natural world. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For Humboldt, the climb of Chimborazo had been like a botanical journey that moved from the equator to the poles, from tropical plants on the valleys to lichens at the tree line. At once, he saw all of nature laid out before him. He formulated that new vision into a single sketch that illustrated nature as a web into which everything was connected. He called the sketch his Naturgem&a;auml;lde&a;mdash;in essence, &a;ldquo;a painting of nature&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For the first time in Western science, the Naturgem&a;auml;lde showed that nature was a globally connected force with corresponding climate zones across continents. As shown below, the extremely intricate sketch showed a mountain front and center, with several columns of writing on either side. By picking a particular height up the mountain in one column, one could trace across the mountain to other columns to see the temperature and atmospheric pressure, while at the same time what species of animals and plants could be found at different elevations. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;The temperature and pressure measurements recorded by Humboldt on his ascents were the first empirical evidence that linked decreasing temperatures to increasing altitude. This relationship allowed him to better understand the link between climate and vegetation zones. As he put it, &a;ldquo;The great elevation attained in several tropical countries, not only by single mountains but even extensive districts, enables the inhabitants of the torrid zone to behold also those vegetable forms which, demanding a cooler temperature, would seem to belong to other zones.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ability to relate the growth of vegetation to their surroundings essentially defined climate. This revelation was integral in the work of Wladimir K&a;ouml;ppen (1846&a;ndash;1940), whose name is linked to the K&a;ouml;ppen Climate Classification System that remains in common use today.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As a result of his journeys and expeditions, by 1817, at the age of 48, Humboldt had measured the weather in enough places to create a map that connected points of equal temperatures across the globe. This was the world&a;rsquo;s first isothermic map, a term coined by Humboldt (although not the first map of isolines ever produced; Edmund Halley, 1656&a;ndash;1742, is recognized as the first to draw isolines). Humboldt&a;rsquo;s goal was to develop a better understanding of the global distribution of plant species. In his travels in South America, Humboldt was impressed by how similar species were between these New and Old Worlds, hypothesizing that temperature played a key role. This was a milestone in weather and climate analysis. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt noted, &a;ldquo;Thus we see that circles of equal annual heat, or&a;mdash;to use a new term&a;mdash;isotherms, are not parallel to the equator but &a;hellip; they cut the geographic parallels under a variable angle slantwise.&a;rdquo; This was a revolutionary observation, since up to that time, the concept of &a;ldquo;climate&a;rdquo; was essentially derived from the Greek word for inclination, which essentially coupled a location&a;rsquo;s climate to latitude. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On Humboldt&a;rsquo;s isothermal chart below (1817), you can clearly see that the lines of constant temperature are not strictly zonal (west-east), but rather dip over the North American continent and rise over the North Atlantic Ocean. This is essentially the first rendition of a map to show the how the temperature of continents differed from the coastal areas, running colder in the winters and warmer in the summers for the same latitude, a concept now known as continentality. The rise in the isotherms over the North Atlantic also reflects the extension of the warm Gulf Stream, known as the North Atlantic Drift, toward the British Isles.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;There was yet another connection that Humboldt discovered regarding ocean currents and climate, while sailing off the west coast of South America. In his measurements of the velocity and temperature of those waters, he discovered a cold ocean current&a;mdash;the Humboldt Current, as it is now called. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Finally, in the bottom right-hand corner of the figure below, he plots the temperature with altitude showing the relationship to both. As noted in Stephen Vermette&a;rsquo;s Weatherwise article, the discovery of that current eventually provided the evidence and connection to explain the &a;ldquo;aridity of coastal Peru and Ecuador: cooled air passing over the current limits precipitation. In short, Humboldt&a;rsquo;s measurements and observations added three new climate controls&a;mdash;altitude, continentality, and ocean currents&a;mdash;to the one climate control (latitude)&a;rdquo; that had been the rule up until that time.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn5\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s expanding vision&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was considered one of the first scientists to tie together the concept of human-induced climate change. As noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;he was the first to explain the fundamental functions of the forest for the ecosystem and climate: the trees&a;rsquo; ability to store water and enrich the atmosphere with moisture, the protection of the soil, and their cooling effect.&a;rdquo; He discussed the impacts of trees on climate through the release of oxygen, noting the effect of the human species intervention was already &a;ldquo;incalculable&a;rdquo;, insisting that it could become catastrophic if they continued to disturb the world so &a;ldquo;brutally&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s writing was not limited to science. He also spoke out against the brutality of slavery, at a time when it was widespread. After he had returned to Europe, in 1810, Humboldt wrote a book titled &l;em&g;Political Essay on the Island of Cuba&l;/em&g;. In this book, he called slavery &a;ldquo;possibly the greatest evil ever to have afflicted humanity&a;rdquo; and proposed setting aside public funds to buy slaves their freedom. As &l;a href=\&q;https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/novemberdecember/feature/humboldt-in-the-new-world\&q;&g;noted by Anna Maria Gillis&l;/a&g; in the NEH journal Humanities, &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ideas so infuriated officials in Havana that they banned his book.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The culmination of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s journeys and knowledge was his multi-volume book series entitled Cosmos. The first volume, which he published at the age of 76 in 1845, was unlike any previous book on nature. Unlike other scientists, he did not write about one topic. Rather he tied all of nature, from outer space to the inner core of the planet, together. Wulf notes that &a;ldquo;where other scientists focused only on meteorological data such as temperature and weather, Humboldt was the first to understand climate as a system of complex correlations between the atmosphere, oceans and landmasses.&a;rdquo; Cosmos sold over 20,000 copies in German in its first couple months. Two years later, another 40,000 copies in English sold, many of those to U.S. readers, establishing him as a household name across North America. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was the consummate Renaissance man. In addition to his amazing journeys to remote parts of the globe, he shaped the way in which we all view nature today. He was able to tie it all together and treat the world as one interconnected ecosystem. He had a wonderful curiosity and treated nature as something you live and experience with all of your senses. I encourage you to explore much more about Humboldt&a;rsquo;s life and legacy, starting with the book I have already read twice: &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;. &l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;07a593de-0d5f-4563-bb8a-df58d08d1a80&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;Michele Tantussi/Getty Images&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;People pass by a billboard showing an image of Prussian explorer, geographer, and natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt at the entrance of the Humboldt University on April 3, 2019, in Berlin, Germany, as the nation commemorated the 250th anniversary of von Humboldt&s;s birth.

(Jim Pire)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In the early summer of 2010, Dr. Perry Samson (meteorology professor at the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor and co-founder of Weather Underground) approached me with the proposition to begin blogging for Weather Underground as a result of my book &l;em&g;Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book&l;/em&g;, which he was using as an ancillary text for some of the courses he taught at UM. Perry introduced me to WU co-founder Dr. Jeff Masters, who was running the company at the time. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Jeff and I decided that I would become the company&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;weather historian&a;rdquo;, and I posted my first blog entry for WU in September 2010. For the first two years I blogged once a week, along with Jeff and Ricky Rood. Then, in late 2012 I picked up the pace and began posting three times weekly. This continued for the next few years until the end of 2014, when Bob Henson joined WU and took on the primary blogging responsibilities. This was a relief for me since I was finding it increasingly difficult to pen three blogs a week on historical weather events. Since then I gradually reduced my blogging from once a week to once a month, my pace for the past four years. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;All in all, I posted around 400 blogs for WU. As Category 6 is now winding down (see the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10), this final post of mine consists of some of what I consider to have been my most interesting blogs over the course of the ten years I worked for Weather Underground.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;My fourth blog entry for WU, posted in October 2010, was probably the most influential:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/questions-concerning-the-world-record-1364f-58c-at-al-aziza-li.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Questions Concerning the World Record 136.4&a;deg;F (58&a;deg;C) at Al Azizia, Libya&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The images for this entry have been lost (sorry!). The post led to an official investigation of the record by the World Meteorological Organization. I was invited to be a member of this committee, along with a dozen other climatologists from around the world. The investigation resulted in the record being &l;a href=\&q;https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/wmo-ninety-year-old-world-temperature-record-el-azizia-libya-invalid\&q;&g;officially overturned&l;/a&g;. The full committee report was simultaneously published in a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/94/2/199/60223/World-Meteorological-Organization-Assessment-of\&q;&g;BAMS article&l;/a&g; in February 2013. I blogged on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-heat-record-overturneda-personal-account.html\&q;&g;this report&l;/a&g; (with images saved this time) in September 2012, when the WMO made its official proclamation. The story even made the front page of the New York Times on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/science/earth/death-valley-temperature-record-is-restored.html\&q;&g;December 29, 2012&l;/a&g;&a;mdash;my Andy Warhol &a;ldquo;fifteen minutes of fame&a;rdquo;!&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Weather Underground produced a feature documentary, &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo;, concerning the two-year long investigation. The documentary is actually more exciting than you might think. It was a professional production and covered not just one but two Libyan revolutions which had a part in the WMO investigation. In February 2011 Khalid El-Fadli, who was the director of Libya&a;rsquo;s meteorological service and a key member of the investigation, went missing for six-plus months. &a;rdquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; is 25 minutes long, but worth the effort to view. It&a;rsquo;s also the only feature documentary Weather Underground ever produced (we filmed in March-May 2012). At the end of the film I visit Death Valley, which by default became the new record-holder for hottest place on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; can be viewed online &l;a href=\&q;https://vimeo.com/49493739\&q;&g;through Vimeo&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In October 2016 I posted a blog entry, co-authored and researched by William Reid, concerning the Death Valley heat record featured in the last 10 minutes of the WU documentary mentioned above. Although I had concluded in &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; that the Death Valley record from 1913 was most likely valid, I later reconsidered that verdict.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/an-investigation-of-death-valleys-134f-world-temperature-record.html#:~:text=An%20Investigation%20of%20Death%20Valley&s;s%20134%C2%B0F%20World%20Temperature%20Record,-By%3A%20Christopher%20C&a;amp;text=In%202012%20the%20WMO%20(World,Libya%20on%20September%2013%2C%201922.\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;An Investigation of Death Valley&a;rsquo;s 134&a;deg;F World Temperature Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As you can read in that 2016 entry, it was not meteorologically possible for the temperature to have reached 134&a;deg;F (56.7&a;deg;C) at the Greenland Ranch (now Furnace Creek) on July 13, 1913.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The WMO is unwilling to revisit this old record, since they normally do not rehash old weather records (the Libyan investigation was unique). The WMO also feared going down a rabbit hole of investigating what the actual world heat record might be, since there are a number of would-be contenders. See, for instance, this entry I posted in July 2016 on the hottest temperature reports from around the world.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/hottest-reliably-measured-air-temperatures-on-earth.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Hottest Reliably Measured Air Temperatures on Earth&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As you can read, William and I conclude with certainty that the actual hottest temperature ever reliably measured on Earth is 54&a;deg;C (129.2&a;deg;F), shared by Death Valley on June 30, 2013 and Mitribah, Kuwait on July 21, 2016. By the way, following this further investigation I now give the claimed Death Valley 1913 record a validity score of 0. You&a;rsquo;ll have to read the blog to understand what that means.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Another entry of mine, posted in March 2015, did result in a new WMO investigation: the warmest temperature ever measured in Antarctica.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/possible-new-continental-heat-record-for-antarctica.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Possible New Continental Heat Record for Antarctica&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The value of 17.5&a;deg;C (63.5&a;deg;F) was accepted by the WMO in 2015, although this record was &l;a href=\&q;https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146322/antarctica-melts-under-its-hottest-days-on-record\&q;&g;broken again&l;/a&g; in February 2020.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Yet another blog entry of mine, posted in March 2013, also resulted in a WMO investigation concerning what might be the wettest place on Earth. Across 31 complete years of data, the annual average precipitation at Puerto Lopez, Colombia, was an astonishing 13,466.3 mm (530.17&a;rdquo;).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-place-on-earth-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Place on Earth Discovered?&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In this case the WMO came to the conclusion that there were a few too many months of precipitation data missing over the latest 30-year period of record (1981&a;ndash;2010) for Puerto Lopez, to be determined as officially the wettest location on Earth. Regardless of that, there is no question in my mind that Puerto Lopez is, in fact, the wettest location on Earth for which long-term data exists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along the lines of wettest locations around the world is the discovery of a site in Maui, Hawaii, that is likely the wettest location in North America. See this entry I posted in May 2012:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-location-for-the-usa-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Location for the U.S.A.

This entry, posted in September 2013, uncovered an obscure paper published by a French government agency that detailed the event that occurred near Barot, Guadeloupe, on November 26, 1970.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/worlds-greatest-1minute-precipitation-record.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World&a;rsquo;s Greatest 1-Minute Precipitation Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The evidence presented in this report for the a 1-minute rainfall of 1.50&a;rdquo; is just as detailed as the evidence for Unionville, Maryland&a;rsquo;s 1-minute record (1.23&a;rdquo; in 1-minute on July 4, 1956) which is considered the world record for such.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On the subject of world weather records, I&a;rsquo;ve always been intrigued in barometric records.

These posts employed weeks of research. I used only sites with very long PORs, which differs from other similar analysis that incorporated more sites but shorter PORs.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Posted in May 2017:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/us-daily-record-highs-outnumber-lows-5-1-2010\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;U.S. Daily Record Highs Outnumber Lows 5 to 1 since 2010&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I was planning to update this data at the beginning of 2021 to see how the full decade of 2010-2019 eventually turns out.

For the 30-year POR of 1971–2000, there were only three rainfalls—.02” in June 1984, .01” in October 1984, and .04” in May 1992—meaning that the average annual rainfall for the site over this period was is a meager .005”. As of when the above entry was posted (March 2013), not a drop of rain had fallen there since 1992. I don&s;t know how long this dry spell persisted following March 2013, but the 21-year period of no measurable rain (from May 1992 until at least February 2013) is the longest such rainless period yet observed on Earth.

NOAA rated May as tied with 2016 for warmest May on record, while NASA put May 2020 ahead of May 2016 by 0.06&a;deg;C. Minor differences in rankings often occur between NOAA and NASA, due to the different techniques they use to handle data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The year-to-date period of January-May ranks as the second warmest such period on record, just 0.06&a;deg;C behind the record set in 2016. According to NCEI&s;s &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/202003/supplemental/page-2\&q;&g;outlook for annual temperature&l;/a&g;, the year 2020 has more than a 99.9% chance to rank among the five warmest years on record, and a 49% chance of being the warmest year on record. If so, each of the past seven years (including 2020) will have been among the seven warmest years on record.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;NASA classified May 2020 as having the 17th-highest monthly temperature departure from average for any month in the 1,684-month record, dating back to 1880: 1.02&a;deg;C (1.84&a;deg;F) above the 20th century average. All five months of 2020 rank in the top 20 for warmest of any month on record.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Global temperature records are more likely to be set during the peak of the solar cycle--and during strong El Ni&a;ntilde;o events, due to the extra heat the tropical Pacific Ocean gives up to the atmosphere. The remarkable warmth of 2020 has come in the absence of an El Ni&a;ntilde;o event and during the minimum of one of the weakest 11-year solar cycles in the past century, underscoring the dominant role human-caused global warming has in heating our planet.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Global ocean temperatures during May 2020 were the second warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the warmest on record.

Nine severe weather events hit China in May, affecting 26 provinces and killing 20 people. Damage was estimated at $1.1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;2. After peaking as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds, a weakening &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Amphan\&q;&g;Cyclone Amphan&l;/a&g; made landfall near the India/Bangladesh border as a category 2 storm with 100 mph winds. The cyclone triggered evacuations of 4.2 million people, and destroyed or damaged 2.8 million homes in India and 225,000 in Bangladesh. Amphan killed 133 people and left damages estimated at $15 billion, making it the most-costly Indian Ocean tropical cyclone in history. The large number of evacuations likely led to an increase in spread of Covid-19 in both India and Bangladesh.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;3. An extensive severe weather outbreak hit Texas and the Southeast U.S. on May 27 - 28. Supercells produced swaths of large and significant hail, notably near San Antonio, with hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter. Damaging winds hit the Houston metro area, with a gust of 65 mph (105 kph) reported in Harris County. Damage was expected to top $1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through the end of May, Earth had seen 13 billion-dollar weather disasters for the year. The Australian wildfires span the boundary between 2019 and 2020, though, and may end up being classified as a 2019 disaster rather than a 2020 disaster. Three May severe weather outbreaks&a;mdash;two in the U.S., and one in Australia&a;mdash;had over $900 million in damage, and may end up being billion-dollar disasters once final damage tallies are available later in the year. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here is the 2020 list of billion-dollar weather disasters, according to Aon:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;1.

Kenya and Rwanda have been the hardest-hit, with 237 and 209 deaths, respectively, through the end of May.&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Neutral El Ni&a;ntilde;o conditions reign&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;NOAA&a;rsquo;s June 11 &l;a href=\&q;https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/?enso_tab=enso-cpc_update\&q;&g;monthly discussion&l;/a&g; of the state of the El Ni&a;ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) stated that neutral ENSO conditions existed, with neither an El Ni&a;ntilde;o nor a La Ni&a;ntilde;a event in progress. Over the past month, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the benchmark Ni&a;ntilde;o3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5&a;deg;N-5&a;deg;S, 170&a;deg;W-120&a;deg;W) cooled, falling to 0.3&a;deg;C below-average. This is short of the 0.5&a;deg;C below-average threshold needed to be considered La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions, though. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Forecasters at NOAA and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) are calling for a roughly 60% chance of neutral conditions continuing through the Northern Hemisphere summer. They put the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a forming during the autumn or winter at about 45 &a;ndash; 50%, about the same odds as neutral conditions for the period. For the August-September-October peak of the hurricane season, they put the odds of El Ni&a;ntilde;o at 6%, and the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a event at 46% (a rise from the 30% chance given a month ago). Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be much more active during La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions than during El Ni&a;ntilde;o conditions, due to weaker upper-level winds creating lower amounts of wind shear. During La Ni&a;ntilde;a events, the U.S. East Coast from Georgia to Maine sees a significant increase in landfall frequency compared to ENSO-neutral years, according to a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI4063.1\&q;&g;2007 paper&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Arctic sea ice: fourth lowest May extent on record&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Arctic sea ice extent during May 2020 was the fourth lowest in the 42-year satellite record, according to the &l;a href=\&q;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/\&q;&g;National Snow and Ice Data Center&l;/a&g; (NSIDC).

Several of them are atmospheric scientists. The document includes specific calls to action for entities that include NOAA, the National Science Foundation, federal agencies such as NASA and EPA, and federally funded research and development centers such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It stresses:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The time has passed for hand-wringing and inert sympathies. The time has passed for predominantly white scientific organizations to post photos of happy, multiracial groups on their websites in place of actually diversifying their leadership and members. The time has passed for academic units to use images of their isolated Black student/postdoc/faculty member to project more racial harmony than actually exists. The time also has passed for letting a misplaced sense of politeness silence our anguish. It is neither a time for reactive posturing nor the tired responses of &a;lsquo;more research is needed&a;rsquo; and &a;lsquo;this is a difficult problem.&a;rsquo; We are scientists. Solving difficult problems is what we do.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I invited two of my colleagues on the AMS Council who are part of the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; initiative&a;mdash;Dr. Melissa Burt (Colorado State University) and Dr. Vernon Morris (Arizona State University)&a;mdash;to weigh in with their experience and perspective. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;This moment has been incredibly exhausting, frustrating, triggering and, at times, isolating. I&a;rsquo;ve had my moments of feeling alone,&a;rdquo; said Burt, who is a research scientist at CSU&a;rsquo;s Department of Atmospheric Science and Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion at CSU&a;rsquo;s Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, in an email. &a;ldquo;In contributing to &a;lsquo;Listen. Act. Lead,&a;rsquo; I&a;rsquo;ve also felt empowered to continue to make our voices heard, to make the community value our voice, to make our community truly see us. These aren&a;rsquo;t new experiences as Black people in America, in STEM and in the geoscience community.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;While in college, Burt participated in the &l;a href=\&q;https://soars.ucar.edu/\&q;&g;SOARS Program&l;/a&g;, an undergraduate-to-graduate bridge program based at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (I had the great pleasure of serving as a SOARS mentor for several years during my time at UCAR.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The exposure to the research enterprise that SOARS provided many people of color has been impactful, and their foundational mentoring model is one that has been replicated in a number of places,&a;rdquo; said Burt. &a;ldquo;Replicating best practices not only from SOARS, but other &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/\&q;&g;REU&l;/a&g; programs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) and &l;a href=\&q;https://hbculifestyle.com/list-of-hbcu-schools/\&q;&g;HBCUs&l;/a&g; (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) would be a great success. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I think we can look to many of the current and forthcoming leaders who have passed these programs to see what new approaches rise up. My successes, along with my leadership experience, are due in part to my SOARS experience, which helped to launch my network of incredible scientists, colleagues, and friends.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As the founding lead of the AMS Culture and Inclusion Cabinet, Burt looks forward to looking deeply and strategically at how the AMS is evolving. &a;ldquo;How do we integrate and weave a culture of inclusion, belonging, diversity, equity, and accessibility across the AMS, and how can we disseminate this to the broader atmospheric science community?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris, a chemistry professor and researcher at Howard University and Director of Howard&a;rsquo;s atmospheric science program, has carried out extensive field work on atmospheric aerosols and chemistry while also launching several major outreach programs, including a series of NOAA-sponsored &l;a href=\&q;http://ncas.howard.edu/outreach-programs/weather-camp/\&q;&g;CAREERS Weather Camps&l;/a&g; for high school students. Nearly 70% of participants have been Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or Asian/Pacific Islander. (See the &l;a href=\&q;https://chalkdustmagazine.com/black-mathematician-month/conversation-vernon-morris/\&q;&g;2017 profile&l;/a&g; in Chalkdust magazine for more on Morris&a;rsquo;s life and work.)&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I am emotionally exhausted,&a;rdquo; Morris said in an email. &a;ldquo;It is hard to express the frustration, trauma, and pain that magnified over the last two weeks. While it is a sort of &a;lsquo;unveiling&a;rsquo; of racism for much of the white community, it is a profoundly painful reminder of racism for the Black community that tears open old wounds and threatens multi-generational destruction of lives, dreams, and destinies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris has participated in civil rights efforts since his teens, including voter education drives in south Georgia, anti-apartheid protests in Atlanta, and environmental justice initiatives and anti-Klan rallies in Washington, DC. After 25 years at Howard, he will soon start a new position at Arizona State University as the Director of the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. He is also putting his energy into other forms of activism, including working on the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; effort as well as serving on boards and councils that might influence policy. (Along with the AMS Council, Morris is a member of the AGU Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The energy and activity of direct action draws and inspires me,&a;rdquo; he said, &a;ldquo;but I feel that my greater contribution is now in other forms of strategically targeting power.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along with Burt, Morris points to the development and strengthening of science programs at Howard and other HBCUs as one major step forward in the last 10 to 20 years. A group of just six HBCUs have produced the majority of Latinx and African American talent entering the atmospheric sciences in the last few years, Morris said. &a;ldquo;If those models were propagated, there would be a sea change,&a;rdquo; he added. Programs such as the CAREERS weather camps for high school students are also vital, said Morris.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;New approaches are needed, but we should also be sustaining, extending, and translating some of the best practices from these successes.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;IBM speaks out&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Congress on Monday, IBM chief executive officer Arvind Krishna launched the first step in an IBM push for public policy changes to advance racial justice and combat systemic racism. &a;ldquo;We realize these measures are only a beginning,&a;rdquo; Krishna wrote, &a;ldquo;but IBM wants to help advance this nation&s;s pursuit of equity and justice and we stand ready to work with you to advance policies that will help unify our country and advance our national purpose.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter conveyed IBM&a;rsquo;s interest in working with Congress in three areas:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Police reform: &l;/strong&g;new federal rules should hold police more accountable for misconduct&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Responsible technology policies: &l;/strong&g;technology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Expanding opportunity:&l;/strong&g; training and education for in-demand skills is key to expanding economic opportunity for communities of color&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter noted that IBM &l;a href=\&q;https://apnews.com/5ee4450df46d2d96bf85d7db683bb0a6\&q;&g;no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition or analysis software&l;/a&g;, a technology found to be &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/tech/facial-recognition-study-racial-bias/index.html\&q;&g;prone to widespread racial bias&l;/a&g;. &a;ldquo;IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;a857fb24-cd98-41e4-9fc7-7c6fcee27d18&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;Dr.

Niña continues to fade as we move toward the springtime and waters warm in the Pacific Ocean. The latest update from NOAA says that we’ll have to say bye-bye to La Niña as we move through the next couple of months. This may or may not nudge weather in the Lower 48 in one direction or another, but we talk about what has happened in five previous seasons similar to the forecast for a weakening La Niña. Other weather patterns are likely to drive conditions across the country.&q;,&q;transcript&q;:&q;the tropical Pacific has been very cool this winter season we are indeed in a line minha and as we look ahead it does look like those temperatures will be warming slightly so we&s;re headed towards more neutral in between one media and el Nino so when we look at the past 5 times this particular pattern has happened what we see across the US is generally a warmer and wetter southeastern United States while it remains drier and cooler across the west and the northwest

Storm Iliana will blow through the Great Lakes and New England through Thursday. Chicago, Detroit and Burlington, Vermont, will have to contend with a burst of snow and gusty winds before a break in the snow arrives on Thursday or Friday. Freezing rain could be a problem from southern New England to the Appalachians, including Asheville, North Carolina, Altoona, Pennsylvania, and Boston. The next winter storm will be quickly on Iliana’s tail and will arrive at the very end of the week in the Midwest.&q;,&q;transcript&q;:&q;the parade of water storms it just keeps going late Wednesday night parts of the Great Lakes will see some snow continue into early Thursday morning as the system moves east by Thursday afternoon the northeast is dealing with snow showers that should wrap up by Thursday night in addition to those burst of snow we&s;re also expecting some gusty winds from Chicago to Detroit over to Rochester closer you are to the lake some of those gusts could be as high as 40 miles per hour this whole system continues its trek to the east one of 3 inches of snow for deploying to Chicago Detroit could pick up 5 to 8 inches of snow Boston Albany about an inch of snow but there&s;s also going to be an icing component parts of the Appalachians maybe even as far south as Asheville and don&s;t let your guard down just yet because the next winter storm is on its heels although you may get a break late Thursday by Friday the next system is on its way &q;,&q;auth_required&q;:false,&q;flags&q;:{&q;Facebook&q;:true,&q;Intranet&q;:false,&q;TV

everything in nice it looks sort of lovely when ice covers tree branches like this but wait as an ice storm make roads treacherous this is Somerset Pennsylvania southeast of Pittsburgh and when ice covers power lines that&s;s when they can get heavy and go down causing power outages that&s;s exactly what happened Thursday plows and salt trucks were making the rounds working to get those roads safe as soon as possible the area saw freezing rain accumulations of about a quarter inch or more which is enough to damage trees and trigger power outages

bears in Western Hudson Bay, Canada are shrinking in both size and numbers, and scientists have confirmed why - melting sea ice is cutting their hunting season short, leaving them hungry and struggling on land. A new study from the University of Toronto Scarborough reveals a link between dwindling ice and reduced energy intake in a long-tracked population of polar bears.&q;,&q;transcript&q;:&q;polar bears like this one are going hungry and now researchers know why a new type of study tracked a population of polar bears in Canada focusing on their energy intake from food they found polar bears are eating less and getting weaker if you were cups are being born and those that are born are growing up to be smaller than normal in fact their population has been cut in half so why is this happening scientists say melting ice is cutting into their hunting season last time collecting food equals less time eating food equals less energy gained from food researchers say if it&s;s happening to their bear population is happening elsewhere as rising temperatures worsen climate conditions throughout the arctic &q;,&q;auth_required&q;:false,&q;flags&q;:{&q;Facebook&q;:true,&q;Intranet&q;:false,&q;TV

jet stream will bottle some truly frigid weather up for a few states in the Rockies while much of the South will feel like it is getting an early start on spring. Some astounding differences in temperatures will be felt between the borders while major cities like Atlanta, Denver and Austin could break records for high temperatures. Here’s the temperature forecast to start the week.&q;,&q;transcript&q;:&q;I huge contrast in temperatures is expected as the jet stream divides potentially record warm temperatures across the south all week long with some cold temperatures that are bottled up to the north of the jet stream here&s;s what to expect look at these high temperatures for Monday to start the week in Phoenix in Amarillo there into the eighties meanwhile Great Falls won&s;t even get above 0 at least through Wednesday and there&s;s a contrast in the overnight low temperatures as well temperatures will be above freezing overnight in Salt Lake in Albuquerque in an Oklahoma City meanwhile they&s;ll be below 0 for Billings in Bismarck

caused these beautiful, iridescent clouds in Sweden? And what makes them so special and rare?&q;,&q;transcript&q;:&q;here&s;s something you&s;ve probably never seen before check these out these are polar stratospheric clouds and as their name would suggest you have to be closer to the polls in order to view these typically during the wintertime now these were photographed in corona Sweden and I want to show you where corona sweetness it&s;s in the very northern part of Sweden far enough north that it&s;s above the Arctic Circle and that&s;s where these clouds were photographed now typically they&s;re very bright they sometimes have this iridescent color and a form of very low temperatures has to be colder than 100 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit and typically only when the sun is at a very very low angle

time and looks like he&s;s slipping here right now so he&s;s a yeah he&s;s going towards the the concrete that&s;s it is scary especially when you got that kind of a wait in a load in the cars behind it it&s;s a tough situation because you want to keep keep the road open it&s;s hard to get around cars that stall out or slide if you just get a little bit further we might make it but he may hit the barricade there on the side there you go this looks like we&s;re stuck to see residential roads are even worse and then some of these out curves and overpasses it&s;s going to be a rough day it&s;s

Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|Miss Scarlet (formerly titled Miss Scarlet and The Duke) is a British-American period television crime drama created by Rachael New, starring Kate Phillips and Stuart Martin as the title characters, two Victorian era detectives.[1][4]|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|The first series debuted on Alibi in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2020, and premiered in the United States on 17 January 2021, as part of PBS's Masterpiece anthology series. A second series was announced by PBS on 29 March 2021. It premiered on Alibi in the UK on 14 June 2022, and on PBS in the US on 16 October 2022.

Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|"It was announced in the United States on 29 February 2024, on PBS's Masterpiece website, that the series would be renewed for a fifth series. The announcement also contained the news that the show would be re-titled simply Miss Scarlet,[5] with Stuart Martin as ""the Duke"" departing the show.[6] He was replaced by Tom Durant-Pritchard as Inspector Alexander Blake.[7][8] Season 5 is scheduled to air on 12 January 2025."|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|Plot and characters[edit]|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|In Victorian London, 1882, Eliza Scarlet is left almost penniless when her father, Henry, unexpectedly dies. Although marriage would appear to be her only option for financial security, Eliza resolves to take over her father's detective agency alone, working under his name. Struggling to build her reputation in the male-dominated world of crime-solving, she frequently calls on her childhood friend William Wellington, a gruff Scottish detective inspector of Scotland Yard, for assistance.|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|"William is known in the police force as ""The Duke"" or simply ""Duke"", a nickname referring to the Duke of Wellington.[9] Eliza's late father Henry saved William from the London streets after arriving from Glasgow as a child, and later mentored him as he trained as a policeman. As a result, William looked up to Henry as a father figure. William once kissed Eliza following her dog's death, which he characterises as ""a chaste kiss,"" to her annoyance. Though he is irritated by Eliza's detective aspirations, he cares for her and gradually begins to show respect for her skills."|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|Eliza also befriends Rupert Parker, a wealthy man who provides her with direly needed loans. Rupert is the bachelor (and secretly gay) son of Mrs. Parker, a rich landlady who owns Eliza's home, and relies on Eliza's advice to navigate his personal life. Eliza lives with her housekeeper, Ivy Woods, who helped raise her after Eliza's mother died (some time before the series begins). Eliza and William bicker and argue constantly, but also share moments of subtle flirtation and care for each other deeply.|1
Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|Series writer and creator Rachael New took inspiration for Eliza's character from Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.[9] Born into a middle-class family, Eliza uses her appearance as a refined Victorian lady to her advantage; both clients and suspects underestimate her and she frequently relies on this, her wits, and her father's training to solve cases. William and Eliza work on several cases together, though she is uncredited, causing disputes between them. Eliza also relies on a Black criminal, Moses, for help dealing with the dangerous underworld of London. Moses is amused by Eliza's gumption, and they connect as outsiders to society.|1

Miss Scarlet and The Duke - Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Scarlet_and_The_Duke|"The renewal announcement for series five also mentioned that actor Stuart Martin would be leaving the series, and his character William ""The Duke"" Wellington would be written off the show. As a result the show would be renamed Miss Scarlet starting with the fifth series.[6] Stuart Martin had made the decision himself to leave the show as he felt Miss Scarlet was being held back by The Duke's presence in her life, and the show had taken The Duke's character as far as he could go within the series[24] and that Scarlet's character could ""explore new stories and challenges for now.""[25] The creators said they chose not to kill Martin's character off because ""we just thought it would be too final, too cruel for Eliza, for the audience, and quite frankly, would limit our options for the show going forward, I think. But at this point in their lives, I think Duke and Eliza aren’t ready to be together.""[26]"|1
